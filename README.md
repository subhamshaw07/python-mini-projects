## Project List

### 1. PIN Matcher (`pin_matcher.py`)
* **Logic:** Simulates a security system that compares a user's entry against a stored PIN.
* **Key Concept:** Accurate digit extraction using arithmetic operators (`//` and `%`) instead of string conversion.

### 2. Bank Locker Access (`bank_locker.py`)
* **Logic:** Validates a 6-digit code by splitting it into a locker number and a secret key.
* **Key Concept:** Uses a `while` loop to calculate the sum of digits and checks divisibility.
